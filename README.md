# FXOS8700CQ & MMA8452Q TWI Device Driver 

FXOS8700CQ device driver written in C language and specillay made for nordic micro controllers.  Because MMA8452Q and FXOS8700CQ have same register address thats why this driver also work with MMA8452Q as well. 
If you want to use this driver with other chip you just need to change TWI Protocol functions.   
Currently driver does not support SPI protocol.
